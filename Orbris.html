<p>In the primordial void, before light carved its dominion over darkness, there stirred Orbris, the Embodiment of Chaos. Neither malevolent nor benign, Orbris dances on the edge of creation and oblivion, weaving the fabric of existence into ever-shifting patterns. To invoke Orbris is to invite the whirlwind, to court the storm that rends the veil between potential and reality. Followers seek not Orbris's favor, for such a concept is foreign to the deity; instead, they aspire to become conduits for the primal chaos, to shape and be shaped by the eternal flux.</p>
<p>In the age of Talonmere, Orbris is worshipped, feared, and courted by those who understand the true nature of power—not as a throne to be claimed but as a storm to be directed. [[The Library/The Ancients/The Eldritch Conclave|The Eldritch Conclave]], in their quest for demi-godhood, believes that by harnessing the essence of Orbris, they can transcend their mortal coils and achieve a state of divine chaos.</p>
<p>Orbris's places of worship are as varied as the aspects of chaos, hidden in the chaotic sprawls of cities, in alleys that twist upon themselves, leading pilgrims on a journey without end. Each shrine is an anomaly, defying the laws of nature and magic—water flows uphill, flames freeze, and shadows cast light.</p>
<p>A common sigil is the Ouroboros, a serpent eating its own tail, representing the endless cycle of creation and destruction. Other symbols include fractals, representing the infinite complexity of chaos, and the spiral, a motif that signifies the unpredictability and constant motion inherent to Orbris's nature.</p>
