<p>The Inarii were an enigmatic group of ancient beings who possessed unparalleled knowledge of engineering and arcane sciences. They were renowned for crafting powerful artifacts imbued with both technological marvels and mystical properties. These artifacts, scattered throughout the continent of Talonmere, held immense power and were coveted by many.</p>
<p>Before departing from the planet, the Inarii constructed sophisticated machines capable of traversing the astral plane, allowing them to explore distant galaxies in search of new knowledge and realms. However, in their absence, they left behind guardians known as the Watchers. These enigmatic beings were tasked with protecting the ancient artifacts and preventing them from falling into the hands of malevolent forces, particularly the [[The Library/The Ancients/The Eldritch Conclave|The Eldritch Conclave]], a sinister group seeking to harness forbidden powers for their own dark purposes.</p>
<p>Though the existence of the Watchers is referenced in ancient texts and lore, they have remained elusive, veiled in mystery and myth. Many adventurers and scholars have sought to uncover their secrets, but the Watchers have never been found, their presence only hinted at through cryptic tales and whispers from ages past. As the artifacts of the Inarii continue to surface, the need for the Watchersâ€™ protection becomes increasingly vital, ensuring that the balance of power remains undisturbed and the secrets of the ancients remain safeguarded.</p>
