<p>In the ancient annals of Talonmere's history, a small but sinister group of warlocks emerged, their souls bound by a dark pact with the deity [[Orbris, The God Of Chaos]], the god of chaos and disorder. This clandestine assembly, known as the Eldritch Conclave, delved into forbidden realms of the arcane, seeking to harness the chaotic energies that coursed through the cosmos.</p>
<p>Driven by a thirst for power that bordered on madness, the members of the Conclave embarked on a perilous quest to unlock the secrets of the [[The Library/The Ancients/The Inarii|The Inarii]], ancient engineers whose technological marvels lay scattered across Talonmere. These artifacts, imbued with both mystical properties and advanced engineering, held the key to untold power, power that the Conclave believed could unchain Orbis from its prison in the Nine Hells.</p>
<p>Yet, despite their dark ambitions, the Conclave's efforts were thwarted by the complexity and enigmatic nature of [[The Library/The Ancients/The Inarii|The Inarii]]'s creations. Frustration turned to desperation as their dreams of godhood seemed to slip through their grasp. In their obsession, they delved deeper into the forbidden arts, sacrificing their humanity in pursuit of their dark desires.</p>
<p>Though the Conclave's presence may have faded from Talonmere, the echoes of their dark legacy reverberate through the ages. Their insidious influence continues to shape the course of history, their machinations lurking in the shadows, waiting for the day when they shall return to claim their rightful place as masters of chaos and disorder.</p>
